Stylist.css :: An Object-oriented CSS Boilerplate
==========

Version 3.0

The /scss folder contains the sass make files for Stylist.css and includes the Bourbon mixin set.

The /css folder contains the Stylist css files for production use.

Special thanks to Stubornella. Version 3 integrates much of her OOCSS library, https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss.


Style.css
------------

Style.css is a more stylistic reset providing a wide array of object-oriented css styles.

Style.css includes all of CSS Reset, but more than providing cross-browser consistency, Stylist provides a base line for aesthetic sensibility on web and mobile devices.

Stylist is an Object-oriented CSS system that adds a lot of basic easy to use CSS classes to speed CSS, HTML and Javascript development.

And also includes HTML5 Shim and the CSS Reset. 


Layout.css
-------------

Layout.css contains a 960 grid system for CSS that updates with the browser width. It is taken from a basic responsive design template, Skeleton V1.2 by Dave Gamache (www.getskeleton.com).

There are a lot of layout systems out there, so this piece is separate from the main Style.css file.


Forms.css
-------------

Oh and it includes a complete form styling library. Kept separate for file size considerations.


Lane/Fonts.css
-------------

Also includes a custom font example. We only include one font. Many more are available at Font Squirrel.
