Style.css
=========

*An object-oriented CSS Platform*

Style.css takes the idea of CSS reset, but rather than simply smoothing out the basic styles across browsers, Style.css adds a basic set of common default styles. It takes a bit more liberty than CSS reset, but also provides a bit more style.

Style.css provides an object-oriented interface to CSS by creating simple style names that add simple classes.
