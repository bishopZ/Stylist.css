Stylist.css :: An object-oriented CSS Boilerplate
==========

version 2.0


Style.css
------------

Style.css is a more stylistic reset providing a wide array of object-oriented css styles.

Style.css takes the idea of CSS reset, but rather than simply smoothing out the basic styles across browsers, Style.css adds a basic set of common default styles. It takes a bit more liberty than CSS reset, but also provides a bit more style.

Style.css provides an object-oriented interface to CSS by creating simple style names that add simple classes.

And also includes HTML5 Shim and the CSS Reset. 


Forms.css
-------------

Add forms.css for basic form style. 


Lane/Fonts.css
-------------

Use Lane/style.css as a custom font example. 


Layout.css
-------------

Layout.css contains a 960 grid system for CSS that updates with the browser width. It is taken from a basic responsive design template, Skeleton V1.2 by Dave Gamache (www.getskeleton.com).
